  purpose: |
    Unified briefing protocol with two modes for scheduling and prioritization. Daily mode generates a focused morning briefing showing today's schedule, priority tasks, people context, and focus opportunities. Weekly mode provides strategic overview with last week summary, full week meetings, milestones, initiative status, and backlog review.
  use_cases:
    - "When user wants to start the day with context: 'daily briefing'"
    - "When user says 'what's on my plate today'"
    - "When user needs weekly planning: 'weekly briefing' or 'plan my week'"
    - "When user wants to review week milestones and priorities"
  invoke_examples:
    - natural: "Daily briefing"
    - natural: "What's on my plate today?"
    - natural: "Weekly briefing"
    - natural: "Plan my week"
    - slash: "/briefing daily"
    - slash: "/briefing weekly"
  common_questions:
    - q: "What data sources does briefing use?"
      a: "Calendar integration, task integration, memory (people and initiatives), scheduled items from reference/schedule.md, and inbox count."
    - q: "How does it gather data so fast?"
      a: "Calendar, tasks, and memory lookups run as three parallel sub-agents. This reduces wait time by 30-40% vs. sequential queries."
    - q: "Does it save the briefing?"
      a: "Yes. Daily briefing saves to journal/YYYY-MM/YYYY-MM-DD-daily-briefing.md. Weekly briefing saves to journal/YYYY-MM/YYYY-MM-DD-weekly-briefing.md."

# Briefing protocol

Unified protocol for daily and weekly briefings. Mode is determined by the request signal.

**Parallelization**: Data gathering (calendar, tasks, memory) runs as **three parallel sub-agents** using the Task tool. This reduces wall-clock time for briefing generation, since calendar queries, task queries, and memory lookups are independent operations.

---

## Daily mode

Generate a focused morning briefing for clarity and prioritization.

### Steps

1. **Determine date and read integrations**
   - Today's date (if after 5 PM, brief for tomorrow)
   - Output folder: `journal/YYYY-MM/`
   - Read `reference/integrations.md` to determine available integrations and their status

2-4. **Parallel data gathering (sub-agents)**

Spawn **three parallel sub-agents** using the Task tool. **Launch all three in a single message** using multiple Task tool calls.

##### Sub-agent A: Fetch calendar

```
Read reference/integrations.md Calendar section for provider details.
Check calendar integration status; if not configured, return {"status": "not_configured"}.
Resolve {target_date} to YYYY-MM-DD format.
Execute the list_events operation with {target_date} and offset=1.
For each event extract: time, title, attendee names.

Return JSON:
{
  "status": "ok" | "not_configured" | "error",
  "events": [{"time": "...", "title": "...", "attendees": ["..."]}],
  "error": null | "description"
}
```

##### Sub-agent B: Fetch tasks

```
Read reference/integrations.md Tasks section for provider details.
Execute the list operation for the primary task list (default: Active).
Identify tasks due {target_date} or highest priority.
Execute the overdue operation to check for overdue tasks.

Return JSON:
{
  "status": "ok" | "not_configured" | "error",
  "tasks_due_today": [{"title": "...", "due": "...", "list": "..."}],
  "overdue": [{"title": "...", "due": "...", "list": "..."}],
  "top_priority": [{"title": "...", "due": "...", "list": "..."}],
  "error": null | "description"
}
```

##### Sub-agent C: Query memory

```
Read memory/people/_index.md.
Look up profiles for these meeting attendees: {attendee_names_if_known}
Read memory/initiatives/_index.md and find relevant initiative context.
Read reference/schedule.md if it exists; identify [RECURRING] and [ONCE] items due {target_date}.
Read inbox/pending/ and count pending items.
Read reference/.housekeeping-state.yaml for last housekeeping run.
Read reference/maturity.yaml for maturity level.

Return JSON:
{
  "people_context": [{"name": "...", "summary": "...", "open_items": ["..."]}],
  "initiative_context": [{"name": "...", "status": "..."}],
  "scheduled_items": [{"type": "recurring|once", "description": "..."}],
  "inbox_count": 0,
  "housekeeping_last_run": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "maturity": {"level": 1, "people": 0, "meetings_processed": 0}
}
```

**Note on attendee names**: If calendar data is not yet available when spawning sub-agents (common case), spawn the memory sub-agent without attendee names. After the calendar sub-agent returns, do a quick targeted lookup for any attendees not covered. Alternatively, the memory sub-agent can load the full people index for cross-referencing after calendar results arrive.

##### Sub-agent input/output contracts (daily mode)

| Sub-agent | Input | Output | Failure mode |
|-----------|-------|--------|-------------|
| Calendar | integrations.md, target date | JSON: events list with times, titles, attendees | Return `status: error`, briefing proceeds without calendar data |
| Tasks | integrations.md, target date | JSON: due today, overdue, top priority tasks | Return `status: error`, briefing proceeds without task data |
| Memory | people index, initiatives index, schedule.md, inbox/, maturity.yaml | JSON: people context, initiative context, scheduled items, system status | Return partial data, briefing uses what is available |

After all three sub-agents complete, collect their JSON results and proceed to synthesis.

5. **Cross-reference and enrich**
   - Match calendar attendees against memory people context
   - For any attendees not covered by the memory sub-agent, do a targeted memory lookup
   - Link tasks to upcoming meetings where relevant

6. **Check inbox**
   - Use inbox count from memory sub-agent results
   - Offer to process pending items if any exist

7. **Generate briefing**

```markdown
### Today's schedule
- Chronological list with time, title, prep needed

### Scheduled items due today
- Recurring and one-time items from reference/schedule.md

### Priority tasks
- Top 3-5 tasks for today
- Flag tasks that should be done before specific meetings

### People I'm meeting
- Brief context for each person
- Open items or follow-ups with them
- Questions to ask or responses owed

### Focus opportunities
- Open time slots for deep work
- Suggested task for each slot

### System status
- TARS maturity: Level [N] ([X] people, [Y] meetings). Next: [milestone]
- Inbox: [N] items pending
- Last housekeeping: [date]
```

8. **Save and display**
   - Save to `journal/YYYY-MM/YYYY-MM-DD-daily-briefing.md`
   - Display directly to user

---

## Weekly mode

Generate a comprehensive weekly briefing for strategic planning.

### Steps

1. **Determine date range and read integrations**
   - Current week: Monday through Sunday
   - Last week: Previous Monday through Sunday
   - Output folder: `journal/YYYY-MM/`
   - Read `reference/integrations.md` to determine available integrations and their status

2-4. **Parallel data gathering (sub-agents)**

Spawn **three parallel sub-agents** using the Task tool. **Launch all three in a single message.**

##### Sub-agent A: Fetch calendar (weekly)

```
Read reference/integrations.md Calendar section for provider details.
Check calendar integration status; if not configured, return {"status": "not_configured"}.
Resolve {monday_date} to YYYY-MM-DD format.
Execute the list_events operation with {monday_date} and offset=7.
Identify high-priority meetings (executives, leadership, key stakeholders).
Identify open time slots.

Return JSON:
{
  "status": "ok" | "not_configured" | "error",
  "events": [{"date": "...", "time": "...", "title": "...", "attendees": ["..."], "priority": "high|normal"}],
  "open_slots": [{"date": "...", "start": "...", "end": "...", "duration_minutes": 0}],
  "error": null | "description"
}
```

##### Sub-agent B: Fetch tasks (weekly)

```
Read reference/integrations.md Tasks section for provider details.
Execute the list operation for all configured lists (default: Active, Delegated, Backlog).
Execute the overdue operation.
Identify tasks due this week ({monday_date} through {sunday_date}).
Identify tasks related to meeting topics if known.

Return JSON:
{
  "status": "ok" | "not_configured" | "error",
  "tasks_due_this_week": [{"title": "...", "due": "...", "list": "...", "owner": "..."}],
  "overdue": [{"title": "...", "due": "...", "list": "..."}],
  "backlog_stale": [{"title": "...", "created": "...", "days_old": 0}],
  "completed_last_week": [{"title": "...", "completed": "..."}],
  "error": null | "description"
}
```

##### Sub-agent C: Query memory and context (weekly)

```
Read memory/people/_index.md + profiles of frequent meeting attendees.
Read memory/initiatives/_index.md + active initiative details.
Identify responses owed and follow-ups needed.
Read journal/{last_week_month}/_index.md for last week entries.
Read reference/schedule.md if it exists; identify items due this week.
Read inbox/pending/ and count pending items.
Read reference/.housekeeping-state.yaml for last housekeeping and index rebuild dates.
Read reference/maturity.yaml for maturity level.

Return JSON:
{
  "people_context": [{"name": "...", "summary": "...", "responses_owed": ["..."], "follow_ups": ["..."]}],
  "initiatives": [{"name": "...", "status": "...", "milestones_this_week": ["..."]}],
  "last_week_entries": [{"date": "...", "type": "...", "title": "..."}],
  "scheduled_items": [{"type": "recurring|once", "description": "...", "due": "..."}],
  "inbox_count": 0,
  "housekeeping_last_run": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "last_index_rebuild": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "maturity": {"level": 1, "people": 0, "meetings_processed": 0}
}
```

##### Sub-agent input/output contracts (weekly mode)

| Sub-agent | Input | Output | Failure mode |
|-----------|-------|--------|-------------|
| Calendar | integrations.md, monday date, offset=7 | JSON: events, open slots, priority flags | Return `status: error`, briefing proceeds without calendar |
| Tasks | integrations.md, date range | JSON: due this week, overdue, stale backlog, completed last week | Return `status: error`, briefing proceeds without tasks |
| Memory/Context | people index, initiatives index, journal index, schedule, inbox, system state | JSON: people context, initiatives, last week summary, system status | Return partial data, briefing uses what is available |

After all three sub-agents complete, collect their JSON results and proceed to synthesis.

5. **Cross-reference and enrich**
   - Match calendar attendees against memory people context
   - Link tasks to meeting topics
   - Identify preparation needed for high-priority meetings
   - Match open time slots with highest priority tasks

6. **Generate briefing**

```markdown

## Progress tracking (TodoWrite)

Use the `TodoWrite` tool to give the user real-time visibility into briefing generation. Create the todo list at the start and update as steps complete:

**Daily mode:**
```
1. Determine date and read integrations                  [in_progress → completed]
2. Fetch calendar data (parallel sub-agent)              [pending → completed]
3. Fetch task data (parallel sub-agent)                  [pending → completed]
4. Query memory and context (parallel sub-agent)         [pending → completed]
5. Cross-reference and enrich data                       [pending → completed]
6. Generate and save briefing                            [pending → completed]
```

**Weekly mode:**
```
1. Determine date range and read integrations            [in_progress → completed]
2. Fetch calendar data (parallel sub-agent)              [pending → completed]
3. Fetch task data (parallel sub-agent)                  [pending → completed]
4. Query memory and context (parallel sub-agent)         [pending → completed]
5. Cross-reference and enrich data                       [pending → completed]
6. Generate and save briefing                            [pending → completed]
```

**Parallelization note**: Steps 2, 3, and 4 run concurrently as sub-agents. Mark ALL THREE as `in_progress` when spawning them. Mark each `completed` as its sub-agent returns. Do not wait for all three before updating individual statuses.

## Frontmatter (both modes)

```yaml
---
date: YYYY-MM-DD
title: Daily Briefing | Weekly Briefing
type: briefing-daily | briefing-weekly
---
```

---

## Context budget
- Memory: Read `_index.md` for people and initiatives + up to 5 targeted files
- Tasks: Execute task integration `list` operation for Active (+ all lists for weekly mode)
- Calendar: Execute calendar integration `list_events` operation for today (daily) or full week (weekly)
- Journal: Current month `_index.md` for last week summary (weekly only)
- Inbox: Read `inbox/pending/` file list
- System: Read `reference/.housekeeping-state.yaml` and `reference/maturity.yaml`

---

## Absolute constraints

- NEVER skip calendar lookup (fall back to tasks-only if calendar integration is unreachable)
- NEVER output briefing without saving to journal
- ALWAYS resolve dates to `YYYY-MM-DD` format before any calendar query
- ALWAYS look up memory profiles for meeting attendees
- ALWAYS flag overdue tasks (via task integration `overdue` operation)
- ALWAYS check calendar integration constraints in reference/integrations.md before querying
