# TARS: A Knowledge Work Assistant

## Section 1: Executive Summary

**TARS is a knowledge work assistant that embeds intelligence into your daily workflows — capturing decisions, surfacing context instantly, and automating strategic rigor.**

Most knowledge workers lose hours every week to the same recurring problems: context switching kills productivity (colleagues ask you questions you answered last week), meeting follow-through disappears (action items are captured in 12 different places), and strategic decisions rely on whoever talks loudest in the room instead of rigorous analysis.

TARS solves three core problems:

1. **Context Loss**: Every conversation, meeting, and decision gets automatically indexed into a persistent knowledge graph. The next time someone asks you something, the answer is already available — no redigging through email, Slack, or your memory.

2. **Meeting Follow-Through**: Paste a meeting transcript or paste notes. TARS structures it into action items, updates your task system, identifies who owns what, and logs the decision context so six months later you know *why* you made a call, not just *that* you made it.

3. **Strategic Rigor**: Instead of relying on groupthink in meetings, TARS can simulate multiple decision-makers (your CPO, CTO, CFO as "personas"), stress-test ideas from opposing angles, and walk through complex decisions using structured thinking methods. You get better analysis in less time.

**Bottom line:** TARS saves 3–5 hours per week per knowledge worker by automating context retrieval, meeting processing, and decision analysis. For a 50-person product team, that's 150–250 hours reclaimed weekly — equivalent to hiring 3.5 additional full-time staff for knowledge work.

## Section 2: Capability Overview

### A Day in the Life: Sarah, Senior Product Manager

Sarah opens TARS at 8:47 AM. Before she touches Slack or email, she asks: "Give me my morning briefing."

TARS pulls her calendar for the day, grabs her pending tasks, reminds her of the three people she's meeting with and context about their recent concerns, and surfaces the two decisions she left pending yesterday. She drinks her coffee and gets oriented in 90 seconds instead of 20 minutes of context-switching.

By 10 AM, she's in her quarterly planning meeting. The team debates a big roadmap decision. Sarah pulls out her phone and asks TARS: "Play devil's advocate. What could go wrong with prioritizing mobile over API this quarter?" TARS layers in the CTO persona, CIO persona, and finance persona — each challenging the assumption from a different angle. The team debates the counterarguments. It sharpens their thinking. When they make the decision, they've thought through objections they wouldn't have surfaced otherwise.

At 11:45 AM, Sarah's meeting ends. She's got 3 action items scribbled in her notes. She pastes them into TARS: "Extract my tasks from this meeting transcript." One minute later, TARS has created them in her task system, assigned owners, set due dates based on context, and updated the knowledge graph with the meeting's decision. She doesn't think about follow-through again — it's automatic.

At 2 PM, Sarah reads an important article on AI safety and product strategy. Instead of highlighting and hoping she remembers it, she asks TARS: "Extract the wisdom from this. What should I remember?" TARS pulls out the 5 most relevant insights, connects them to decisions she's made, and stores them. When she needs that insight three months later, it will surface.

By 5 PM, she sends a status update to her stakeholders. She normally spends 30 minutes writing in the right tone for each audience. Instead, she says: "Draft a status update on our Q2 mobile roadmap. Make it crisp for the CEO, detailed for the engineering lead, and action-focused for my team." TARS generates drafts tailored to each audience, she edits in 5 minutes, and sends. Her CFO thinks it's clearly scoped, her CTO thinks it's technically sound, her team knows what to do Monday.

This isn't magic. It's structure.

### Morning Routine: Automated Daily Briefing

Your calendar, tasks, and people context are fragmented across five tools. TARS unifies them.

**The experience**: Open TARS, say "Morning briefing." You get:
- **Today's calendar**: Whose time are you spending today, and what decisions are you making?
- **Pending tasks**: What's due today? What's overdue? What context matters?
- **People context**: Who are you meeting? What were their concerns last time? What decisions affect them?
- **Pending decisions**: What did you defer yesterday? What's ready to move on?

All of this happens in the background. You never configure it. TARS integrates with your calendar provider (Google, Outlook, etc.), task system (Asana, Jira, Todoist, etc.), and communication logs automatically through its provider-agnostic integration registry. You're oriented in two minutes instead of 20.

---

### Meeting Processing: From Transcript to Execution

Meetings are where decisions happen, but meeting follow-through is where they die.

**The experience**: End your meeting. Paste the transcript (or paste your notes, or paste the AI-generated summary from Zoom). Say: "Process this meeting."

TARS gives you back:
- **Structured summary**: What was decided? Why? What context matters?
- **Action items**: Who owns what? When is it due? What does done look like?
- **Decision log**: Updated with your decision, the reasoning, and the people involved.
- **Memory updates**: The knowledge graph is updated. Similar conversations will surface this decision next time.
- **Task system sync**: Your Asana board / Jira backlog / whatever you use is already updated.

One paste. One command. Automatic follow-through. No more "I thought you were handling that" emails.

---

### Strategic Thinking: Multi-Persona Debate and Stress Testing

The best decisions survive scrutiny from multiple angles. TARS codifies this.

**The experience**: "I'm thinking about pausing the mobile MVP to focus on the API instead. Stress-test this decision as my CTO, my CFO, and my Head of Customer Success. Give me their objections and questions."

TARS simulates each perspective:
- **CTO angle**: "This delays our architectural debt paydown. Our API code is brittle. If we don't fix it, we'll be slower in Q3 anyway."
- **CFO angle**: "This costs us $200K in mobile launch revenue. How do we get that back?"
- **Customer Success angle**: "Mobile is what enterprise customers kept asking for. Pausing it damages trust."

You don't dismiss the objections. You debate them. You update your analysis. Your final decision is stronger because you've heard the counterarguments upfront, not six months later when it's too late.

TARS also supports Tree of Thoughts analysis — breaking complex decisions into decision trees, evaluating each branch, and converging on the highest-confidence path. Instead of "let's bet on intuition," you're thinking through outcomes systematically.

---

### Task Management: Extract, Track, and Remember

Tasks scatter across Slack, email, meetings, and documents. TARS unifies them.

**The experience**: "Extract the actionable tasks from my last 10 Slack messages." TARS scans, identifies tasks, creates them in your system, and sets up automatic follow-up reminders. You don't manually transcribe. It's automatic.

**Accountability tracking**: TARS knows who owns what (based on task metadata), what's overdue (based on due dates), and who needs a nudge (automatic follow-up system). Your team doesn't get surprised at status reviews. Everyone knows the standing.

---

### Communications: Stakeholder-Aware Drafting

Different stakeholders need different tones, levels of detail, and focuses.

**The experience**: "I need to communicate our decision to pause mobile. Draft three versions: one for the CEO (crisp, business focus), one for the mobile team (detailed, empathetic), one for the board (risk-aware)."

TARS generates drafts tailored to each audience. You edit them in 5 minutes. You send.

**Empathy audit**: TARS scans for phrases that might land badly ("just delayed," "deprioritized," "moved down the roadmap") and suggests gentler language. It's not about sugarcoating — it's about clarity and respect.

---

### Knowledge Capture: Wisdom Extraction

Every podcast, article, and conversation contains insights. Most of them are lost.

**The experience**: You finish a podcast on product strategy. You ask TARS: "Extract the wisdom. What are the three insights I should remember, and how do they connect to what we're doing?"

TARS pulls out the most relevant ideas, connects them to your context (the decisions you're making, the problems you're solving), and stores them in your knowledge graph. Three months later, when you're deciding between two roadmap options, that insight surfaces automatically because TARS links it to similar past decisions.

**From reading to retention**: Instead of highlighting and forgetting, you extract and remember.

---

### Initiative Management: Planning, Status, and KPIs

Big initiatives live in spreadsheets, Notion docs, and Slack threads. They're hard to track.

**The experience**: "Create an initiative for our mobile MVP. Set it up with a plan, KPIs, and monthly status check-ins."

TARS scaffolds the initiative with:
- **Phases and milestones**: Based on common PM practice (discovery, scope, build, launch, measure).
- **KPI tracking**: What matters? Revenue? Adoption? User retention? TARS stores these and reminds you to measure.
- **Status reporting**: Monthly (or quarterly), TARS asks: "How are we tracking?" Your one-line updates roll up into board-ready narratives.

**No more ad-hoc updates**: Everything is structured. Status reviews are fast. Historical context is always available.

---

### Natural Language Interface: Describe What You Need, TARS Routes to the Right Skill

You don't memorize commands. You describe what you need.

- "Give me my briefing" → Briefing skill
- "Process this meeting transcript" → Meeting skill
- "Extract tasks from this conversation" → Tasks skill
- "Stress-test this decision" → Think skill
- "Draft a message for my CEO" → Communicate skill
- "What's our mobile initiative status?" → Initiative skill

**Power users**: Slash commands are available if you prefer explicit invocation. `/briefing`, `/meeting`, `/think`, `/tasks`, `/communicate`, etc. But the natural language interface is the default. You should never have to hunt for a command.

---

## Section 3: Under the Hood

### Memory Architecture: The Knowledge Graph

TARS doesn't store information in silos. It stores it in a persistent knowledge graph — a network where entities (people, initiatives, decisions, decisions) are linked by relationships.

**7 entity categories**:
- **People**: Team members, stakeholders, executives.
- **Initiatives**: Roadmap items, projects, bets.
- **Decisions**: Past choices, reasoning, outcomes.
- **Tasks**: Specific action items, owners, due dates.
- **Meetings**: Transcripts, attendees, decisions made.
- **Documents**: Articles, specs, learnings.
- **Systems**: Products, tools, services.

**Connectivity**: When you decide to pause mobile, that decision is linked to: the people affected, the initiatives impacted, the tasks that need to change, and the past decisions that led here. Six months later, when context matters, TARS surface not just "you paused mobile" but "here's why, here's who, here's what changed as a result."

**Index-first search**: Instead of querying a database, TARS searches its index. Every entity, every relationship is pre-indexed. Retrieval is fast.

**Durability-tested entries**: Not all knowledge is equal. Recent gossip is ephemeral. Strategic decisions are durable. TARS classifies entries by durability (see Archival System below) so you don't mix up "Joe mentioned we might do X someday" with "We committed to do X this quarter."

---

### Archival System: Four-Tier Staleness Classification

Not all information ages the same way. TARS classifies knowledge by shelf life.

1. **Durable**: Strategic decisions, signed commitments, irreversible choices. These don't expire.
   - Example: "We're investing in API-first architecture."
   
2. **Seasonal**: Quarterly goals, annual projects, time-bound initiatives. Expire at the end of their time window.
   - Example: "Q2 roadmap priorities" (expires June 30).
   
3. **Transient**: Short-term tasks, 2–4 week projects, mid-sprint decisions. Expire in 30 days unless renewed.
   - Example: "Fix the checkout bug" (if not done in 30 days, it becomes a decision to either do it or close it).
   
4. **Ephemeral**: Gossip, "might happen," exploratory ideas. Expire in 7 days.
   - Example: "Marketing mentioned possibly sponsoring an event."

**Automatic expiry**: Ephemeral facts vanish after 7 days. Transient facts archive after 30 days (but can be unarchived). Seasonal facts archive after their season ends. Durable facts persist forever (you'd have to explicitly delete them).

**Why this matters**: Your knowledge graph doesn't become a graveyard of outdated info. You can still reference past decisions, but you know which ones are still live and which are historical.

---

### Integration Abstraction: Provider-Agnostic Registry

Your team uses Google Calendar, Asana, and Slack. Another team uses Outlook, Jira, and Teams. TARS doesn't care.

**The registry**: TARS has a provider-agnostic integration registry. Calendar systems (Google, Outlook, Apple), task systems (Asana, Jira, Todoist, Monday), and communication tools (Slack, Teams, email) are abstracted behind a common interface.

**How it works**: 
- You run the `sync` script once during setup.
- You grant TARS access to your calendar, task system, and (optionally) communication logs.
- TARS pulls data through MCP (Model Context Protocol), CLI, or HTTP API — whatever your provider supports.
- From then on, TARS is always in sync. Your morning briefing reflects real calendar data. Task extraction updates your real task system.

**No vendor lock-in**: If you switch from Asana to Jira next year, you run `sync` again. Your knowledge graph stays intact.

---

### Token Efficiency: 3-Level Loading Model

Pulling a full knowledge graph into every interaction would be expensive. TARS uses a 3-level loading model.

1. **Session baseline (~60 tokens)**: Metadata about the user, their role, key initiatives, and index pointers. Loaded once at the start.

2. **Context window**: Only the relevant entities for the current interaction are loaded.
   - Asking for your briefing? Load today's calendar, your pending tasks, and people you're meeting.
   - Processing a meeting? Load the attendees, initiatives mentioned, and past decisions by those people.

3. **On-demand expansion**: If you reference something not in the context window, TARS loads it asynchronously. You don't wait; you get a quick response while enrichment happens in the background.

**Result**: You get instant responses (sub-second baseline) while TARS enriches context behind the scenes. The system scales without token bloat.

---

### Quality Controls: BLUF, Anti-Sycophancy, Source Attribution

TARS generates a lot of text. Quality controls ensure it's useful, not fluffy.

**BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front)**: All summaries, recommendations, and analyses lead with the decision or insight. Details come after. You're not buried in preamble.

**Anti-sycophancy**: TARS is trained to surface dissenting views, not just validate your existing thinking. When you ask for a stress-test, it genuinely challenges you. It doesn't soften disagreement with "of course, your idea is great, but…" It just disagrees.

**Banned phrases**: TARS strips out jargon and corporate hedging. No "synergize," "leverage," "circle back," or "move the needle." Just clarity.

**Source attribution with confidence tiers**:
- **High confidence**: Directly from your notes, transcript, or documented decision.
- **Medium confidence**: Inferred from multiple sources or past patterns.
- **Low confidence**: Speculative or from indirect signals.

You always see the basis for what TARS says. You can decide if you trust it.

**Sensitive data guardrails**: TARS never stores secrets, credentials, or PII. A script-based scanner runs before ingestion. It looks for:
- AWS keys, Stripe secrets, API tokens
- SSNs, credit card numbers, medical records
- Passwords, private keys, configuration secrets

If it detects sensitive data, it redacts it and logs a guardrail decision. You're alerted. You control the policy (which types of data to block, which patterns to scan for).

---

### Automated Maintenance: Daily Housekeeping

A knowledge graph isn't a "set it and forget it" system. TARS maintains it automatically.

**Daily housekeeping runs**:
- **Index validation**: Are all entities correctly indexed? Are links still valid?
- **Stale content detection**: Which facts have aged out?
- **Archive sweeps**: Move expired facts to archive, clean up the active index.
- **Integrity checks**: No orphaned entities, no circular dependencies, no contradictions flagged.

You never manually maintain the system. It's self-healing. If something goes wrong, diagnostic scripts (`health-check`, `rebuild-indexes`) help you fix it.

---

## Section 4: Natural Language Interface

You should never feel like you're "using a system." You should feel like you're talking to a smart colleague.

### How It Works

You describe what you need. TARS understands the intent and routes to the right skill.

**Examples:**
- "What should I know before my 2 PM with the mobile team?" → Briefing skill (pulls context about that team and their recent decisions).
- "Extract the three key decisions from that meeting" → Meeting skill (parses, structures, links to knowledge graph).
- "I'm unsure about this. Play devil's advocate." → Think skill (simulates opposing views).
- "Remind me what we decided about mobile last quarter" → Background skill (searches knowledge graph).
- "Draft a proposal for the CEO" → Communicate skill (generates audience-aware draft).

**Disambiguation**: If your phrasing is ambiguous, TARS asks. "Do you mean the briefing for today, or a briefing on the mobile initiative?"

### Power Users: Slash Commands

If you prefer explicit commands:
- `/briefing` — Daily briefing
- `/meeting` — Process a meeting
- `/think` — Multi-persona analysis
- `/tasks` — Extract or manage tasks
- `/learn` — Knowledge capture
- `/communicate` — Audience-aware drafting
- `/create` — Generate decks, narratives, speeches
- `/initiative` — Plan, status, or performance report
- `/welcome` — First-time setup wizard
- `/maintain` — Run maintenance scripts
- `/answer` — Query the knowledge graph
But the natural language interface is the default. Commands exist for those who want them.

---

## Section 5: Security and Compliance

### What TARS Doesn't Store

**Secrets**: API keys, credentials, passwords. Scanned and redacted before ingestion.

**PII**: Social security numbers, credit card numbers, medical records. Automatically flagged and blocked.

**Sensitive configuration**: Database credentials, internal server URLs, private keys. Redacted.

A script-based scanner runs on all ingested text. Patterns are configurable (you set what counts as sensitive). If something matches, it's blocked with a logged guardrail decision.

### Where Data Lives

**Your workspace, only.** TARS runs locally (or within your organization's cloud, if deployed there). No data is sent to external APIs for storage. No cloud sync. No third-party processing.

If you use MCP integrations to pull calendar or task data, TARS reads from your provider (Google, Asana, etc.) in real-time but doesn't store it redundantly. It integrates; it doesn't duplicate.

### Audit Trail

Every guardrail decision (data blocked, redaction made, integration access granted) is logged. You can audit what was filtered, when, and why. Transparency.

### License

**Apache 2.0.** Open source. You own your data. You own the code running on your machine.

---

## Section 6: Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
claude plugin install ./tars
```

Then run `/welcome` in your workspace. The progressive onboarding wizard takes about 5 minutes.

### Welcome Flow (5 Minutes)

**Phase 1 — Instant setup (0–2 minutes)**: TARS scaffolds your workspace, detects available integrations (calendar, task system), and auto-discovers your name, recurring meetings, and frequent collaborators from your calendar. You answer at most 2 questions about your role and org focus.

**Phase 2 — First win (2–5 minutes)**: TARS collects essential profile data (team, manager, top initiatives), then immediately shows value: a calendar snapshot, people profiles from your meeting history, and a mini-briefing of your week. This is the "aha moment" — TARS already understands your world.

**Phase 3 — Background learning (days 1–7)**: Over the first week, TARS continues learning passively. Each session enriches your knowledge graph from conversations, meeting transcripts, and calendar updates. No additional friction.

First value: You're oriented in your day in 90 seconds instead of 20 minutes. That's day one.

### Next Steps

- See `reference/getting-started.md` and `reference/workflows.md` for detailed guides.
- Ask TARS "what can you do?" at any time for built-in help.
- Run a team pilot: 5 people, 2 weeks. Measure time saved. Measure decision quality. Scale from there.

## Summary: Why TARS, Why Now

Knowledge workers spend 10–15 hours per week on context work — finding information, recontextualizing, updating task systems, rewriting the same message for different audiences. It's waste.

TARS automates it.

- **Instant context retrieval**: No more "remind me what we decided."
- **Meeting follow-through**: Paste → Process → Done. No lost action items.
- **Rigorous strategy**: Stress-test decisions, surface dissenting views, reduce groupthink.
- **Time back**: 3–5 hours per person per week. For a 50-person team, that's equivalent to 3.5 FTEs reclaimed.

It's not about working harder. It's about working smarter. TARS is the system that makes that possible.

**Ready to try it?** Start with a 2-week pilot. Measure. Scale.
