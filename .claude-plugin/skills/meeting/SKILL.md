# Meeting processor protocol

Process meeting transcripts to extract structured reports, persist to journal, create tasks, and extract memory using a unified orchestrated pipeline.

---

## Pipeline overview

This skill combines transcript analysis, structured report generation, task extraction, memory persistence, and journal creation into a single coordinated workflow. Progress is tracked with real-time TodoWrite updates.

**Parallelization**: After the journal entry is saved (Step 3), task extraction (Step 4) and memory extraction (Step 5) run as **parallel sub-agents** using the Task tool. This yields a 30-40% wall-clock improvement on typical meetings. Both sub-agents read from the saved journal file, ensuring isolated context and no cross-contamination.

---

## Step 1: Process transcript (MANDATORY)

### 1.1: Load replacements (MANDATORY)

Read `reference/replacements.md` BEFORE processing any content. Apply canonical names to ALL text: frontmatter, prose, action items, task assignments.

### 1.2: Input handling

The transcript may be:
1. **Plain text** with speaker labels and timestamps
2. **JSON array** with `SPEAKER`, `LINE_TEXT`, `LINE_ID` fields

### 1.3: Speaker name resolution (MANDATORY)

- If speaker names are generic ("Speaker 1"), infer real names from context
- Identify the user from role references matching CLAUDE.md identity
- NEVER use generic speaker labels in output

### 1.4: Calendar lookup (MANDATORY WHEN AVAILABLE)

Read `reference/integrations.md` Calendar section for provider details and status. If calendar integration is configured, query for this meeting if date/time can be inferred. Resolve the meeting date to `YYYY-MM-DD` format before querying. Execute the `list_events` operation with the meeting date and offset=1.

**Why:** Calendar provides full attendee list (including silent participants), official meeting title, organizer, and meeting notes/agenda.

**Extract:**
- Complete attendee list (for `participants` frontmatter)
- Meeting time
- Organizer
- **Calendar meeting title** (authoritative source for filename and title)

If meeting not found or calendar integration is unreachable, proceed with transcript-only processing and note the gap.

---

## Step 2: Generate structured report (MANDATORY)

Produce ALL of the following sections from the transcript analysis:

### Topics
- Discussion points as bullet points
- Infer meeting type but do NOT state it

### Updates
- Status updates from anyone OTHER than the user
- Be specific: names, projects, dates

### Concerns
- Risks raised with WHO, ISSUE, DEADLINE

### Decisions
- What was decided and who made the call

### Action items
Classify into:
- **For me**: Tasks the user committed to
- **For others**: Tasks assigned to specific people
- **Unassigned**: Needed but not assigned

Format: **"Owner"** -- Task description (deadline if stated)

---

## Step 3: Save to journal (MANDATORY)

Create file in `journal/YYYY-MM/`:

**Filename:** `YYYY-MM-DD-meeting-slug.md`

**Template:**
```yaml
---
date: YYYY-MM-DD
title: Meeting Title
calendar_title: Original Calendar Title  # Only if different from title
type: meeting
participants: [Name1, Name2, Name3]
organizer: Name  # From calendar if available
topics: [topic1, topic2]
initiatives: [Initiative1, Initiative2]
source: calendar | transcript  # Indicate primary data source
---
```

```markdown
# Meeting Title
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD | **Participants:** [[Name1]], [[Name2]], [[Name3]]
**Initiatives:** [[Initiative1]], [[Initiative2]]

## Topics
[From report]

## Updates
[From report]

## Concerns
[From report]

## Decisions
[From report]

## Action items
[From report]
```

### Title and slug generation

**Title priority hierarchy:**
1. **Calendar meeting title** (authoritative source when available)
2. **Transcript header/title** (fallback when no calendar data)
3. **Context-inferred title** (last resort, based on content analysis)

**Slug rules:**
- Lowercase, hyphenated
- Remove filler words
- Example: "MCP Planning Session" -> `mcp-planning`

When calendar title is used, if it differs significantly from transcript context, keep `calendar_title` in frontmatter for reference.

---

## Steps 4 and 5: Parallel sub-agent execution (MANDATORY)

After saving the journal entry in Step 3, spawn **two parallel sub-agents** using the Task tool. Both sub-agents run concurrently, reading from the saved journal file path rather than from the raw transcript in context.

**Launch both sub-agents in a single message** using multiple Task tool calls. Do NOT wait for one to complete before starting the other.

### Sub-agent A: Task extraction

Spawn a Task sub-agent with the following prompt structure:

```
You are extracting tasks from a meeting journal entry.

Read the journal file at: {journal_file_path}
Read the task integration config at: reference/integrations.md (Tasks section)

For each action item in the journal:
1. Apply accountability test (NEVER create tasks for "Team" or "We" without a specific lead)
2. Check for duplicates: execute the task integration `list` operation for all configured lists
3. Resolve metadata:
   - Map relative dates to YYYY-MM-DD using date resolution
   - Default to `backlog` if no due date
   - Source: {journal_file_path}
4. Execute the `add` operation via the task integration with metadata in notes field
5. Place in appropriate list based on owner and due date:
   - Has due date + owner is user -> `Active` list
   - Has due date + owner is other -> `Delegated` list
   - No due date -> `Backlog` list

Return a JSON summary of tasks created:
{
  "tasks_created": [
    {"title": "...", "owner": "...", "list": "...", "due": "..."}
  ],
  "duplicates_skipped": [...],
  "errors": [...]
}
```

Standard task creation fields:
```
title: "Task description"
list: Active
due: YYYY-MM-DD
notes: |
  source: journal/YYYY-MM/YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md
  created: YYYY-MM-DD
  initiative: [[Initiative Name]]
  owner: Name
```

### Sub-agent B: Memory extraction

Spawn a Task sub-agent with the following prompt structure:

```
You are extracting durable memory from a meeting journal entry.

Read the journal file at: {journal_file_path}
Read memory indexes: memory/people/_index.md, memory/initiatives/_index.md, memory/decisions/_index.md

Apply durability test to insights from the meeting:
- Stakeholder updates -> memory/people/{name}.md
- Initiative updates -> memory/initiatives/{name}.md
- Decisions -> memory/decisions/{slug}.md
- Update relevant _index.md files

Do NOT persist: scheduling logistics, temporary blockers, action items.
Use [[wikilink]] syntax for all entity references.
Read reference/replacements.md and apply canonical names.

Return a JSON summary of memory updates:
{
  "created": [{"path": "...", "summary": "..."}],
  "updated": [{"path": "...", "summary": "..."}],
  "skipped": [{"insight": "...", "reason": "failed durability test"}]
}
```

### Collecting sub-agent results

After both sub-agents complete, collect their results and merge into the output summary. If either sub-agent fails:
- Log the failure in the output summary
- Do NOT retry automatically (the user can re-run the failed step manually)
- The other sub-agent's results are still valid and should be reported

### Sub-agent input/output contracts

| Sub-agent | Input | Output | Failure mode |
|-----------|-------|--------|-------------|
| Task extraction | Journal file path, integrations.md Tasks section, replacements.md | JSON: tasks created, duplicates skipped, errors | Report errors in summary, do not block memory extraction |
| Memory extraction | Journal file path, memory indexes, replacements.md | JSON: files created, files updated, insights skipped | Report errors in summary, do not block task extraction |

**Shared constraints for both sub-agents:**
- Read from the saved journal file, NEVER from raw transcript context
- Read `reference/replacements.md` and apply canonical names
- Each sub-agent operates with isolated context (no shared state)
- Neither sub-agent should modify the journal file
- Memory extraction must use `.lock` files when writing shared memory files (see core skill cowork protocol)

---

## Step 6: Replacement verification (MANDATORY)

Scan ENTIRE output for any terms from `reference/replacements.md` that were not replaced. Correct before saving.

### Auto-add unknown names

When processing transcripts, if new names are found that:
- Are not in `reference/replacements.md`
- Appear to be nicknames, abbreviations, or informal names (e.g., "Mick", "JT", "Dan")

Add them to `reference/replacements.md` with a placeholder for the user to complete:

```markdown
| Mick | ?? (needs full name) |
| JT | ?? (needs full name) |
```

This allows the user to update canonical names as needed without losing track of unknown references. Report these additions in the output summary.

## Output summary

End your response with:

```markdown
---
## Meeting context
Created: `journal/YYYY-MM/YYYY-MM-DD-meeting-slug.md`

## Task updates
| Operation | Task | Details |
|-----------|------|---------|
| Created | Task description | Owner, due date, destination |

## Memory updates
| Action | File | Summary |
|--------|------|---------|
| Created/Updated | `memory/path/file.md` | What changed |

## Summary
- Journal entry created (file path)
- Tasks created (count by list)
- Memory entries created or updated (count by category)
- Any warnings or gaps (e.g., names not in replacements.md, calendar lookup failed)
```

---

## Progress tracking (TodoWrite)

Use the `TodoWrite` tool to give the user real-time visibility into pipeline progress. Create the todo list at the start and update as steps complete:

```
1. Process transcript and generate structured report     [in_progress → completed]
2. Save journal entry                                    [pending → completed]
3. Extract tasks (parallel sub-agent)                    [pending → completed]
4. Extract memory (parallel sub-agent)                   [pending → completed]
5. Replacement verification                              [pending → completed]
6. Compile and return summary                            [pending → completed]
```

**Parallelization note**: Steps 3 and 4 run concurrently. Mark BOTH as `in_progress` when spawning the sub-agents. Mark each `completed` as its sub-agent returns. If one sub-agent completes before the other, update its status immediately without waiting for the other.

Mark each step `in_progress` before starting it and `completed` immediately after. If a step fails, keep it as `in_progress` and add a new todo describing the issue.

---

## Context management

For long transcripts (>30 minutes or >5,000 words), offload intermediate results to files rather than keeping everything in context:

1. After Step 3 (save to journal), the journal file path becomes the canonical source for all subsequent steps
2. Both parallel sub-agents (task extraction and memory extraction) read from the saved journal file, NOT from the raw transcript in context
3. Each sub-agent operates in isolated context via the Task tool, which naturally prevents context overflow
4. The main agent only needs to hold the journal file path and the sub-agent results for the final summary

This architecture means transcript length has minimal impact on Steps 4-5 performance, since sub-agents load only the structured journal output.

---

## Context budget
- Memory: Read `_index.md` + up to 5 targeted files
- Tasks: Execute task integration `list` operation for all configured lists (duplicate check)
- Calendar: Execute calendar integration `list_events` operation for meeting metadata
- Reference: `reference/replacements.md` (mandatory)

---

## Absolute constraints

- NEVER skip any of the 6 core steps
- ALWAYS return a summary (even if some steps failed)
- ALWAYS preserve the source transcript metadata in journal frontmatter
- NEVER skip any of the 5 report sections
- NEVER use generic speaker labels
- NEVER skip saving to journal
- NEVER skip creating tasks from action items
- NEVER omit the replacement verification step
- NEVER output names that appear in replacements.md without using canonical form
